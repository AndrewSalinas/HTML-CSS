<p>My favorite Football team is the Pittsburgh Steelers. I like the CowBoys too but they suck so I would never wear a CowBoys shirt in public.. Plus every time the Steelers went head to head with the CowBoys in the Super Bowl the steelers won.

I don't watch football alot so I don't know any football players. No, that's not true I like that one guy on the Papa Johns commercials, he is on the CowBoys team.
