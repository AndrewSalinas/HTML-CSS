<p>My favorite breed of dog is the German Shepard. They are large dogs and I like big dogs, but I also really like their fur color and they're easy to train.
<li>Fact 1: Their Guarding Skills Are No Joke

So you've seen them around the train stations or the police station with the cops before--no big deal, right? Actually, as it turns out, it's a very big deal, because the German Shepherd dog is actually hailed as the world's leading police, military and guard dog.

Thanks for all the hard work you do out there keeping us safe, guys!

<li>Fact 2: They're Quite Popular

It's not surprising that dogs like Labrador and Golden Retreivers are really popular, right? Those of us who have ever had a German Shepherd as a pet won't be surprised by this, but according to the AKC registration statistics, this dashing breed is actually thesecondmost popular dog in the United States. Way to go!

<li>Fact 3: The Breed Has Been Around for Quite a While

We have Captain Max von Stephanitz from Germany to thank for the breeding of the first German Shepherd back in 1899. As a mix of old breeds of herding and farm dogs, the first American German Shepherd was exhibited in 1907, and thanks to the loveable sidekicks known as Rin-Tin-Tin and Strongheart, the breed quickly shot up the ranks of popularity.

<li>Fact 4: For a While There, German Shepherds Were No. 1

German Shepherds were the No. 1 most popular dog in the United States in 1925, and stayed that way for the rest of the 1920s before disappearing from the top 10 until after World War II.

<li>Fact 5: They Make Fine Family Companions

My favorite breed of cat is the Persian cat. They are like puffy cats, I like their fur. And I'm not making not this up because I don't like cats. <li>
1. THEY WERE A TRAVELER'S SOUVENIR. 

Like many breeds, the Persian cat’s origins are a mystery. According to some sources, longhaired cats have existed in the Middle East for thousands of years—although research indicates that the kitties have genetics in common with cats from Western Europe.

Although nobody quite knows when—or how—the rest of the world discovered Persian cats, one popular version is that the luxuriously-furred feline was introduced to Western Europe by an Italian named Pietro della Valle. Della Valle was a famous nobleman who journeyed extensively throughout the Holy Land, the Middle East, Northern Africa, and India. In 1620, della Valle passed through Persia—now known as Iran—and took a liking to the exotic, longhaired gray cats he spotted at a bazaar. He purchased four pairs of them, and brought them home with him to Europe. Of course, sailors, travelers, or merchants might have also carried Persians with them from the Middle East to the Continent.

<li>2. THEY WERE IN THE WORLD'S FIRST CAT SHOW. 

More than 250 years later, Persians took London by storm when the breed was showcased in the world's first organized cat show in 1871 at the Crystal Palace. The day-long exhibition also featured Siamese cats, a Scottish Wild Cat, and Manxes, among other exotic felines. Proving that cats were popular long before the Internet, the event drew more than 20,000 visitors. It also shouldn't surprise anyone that a Persian kitten won "Best in Show." 

<li>3. THEY'RE BELOVED IN AMERICA ... 

Sometime after 1895, Persians were brought to the United States. In 1906, the Cat Fanciers' Association was formed in America, and a Persian was one of the first cats registered. Today, the Persian is one of the most popular cats in the United States.

<li>4. ... AND BY FAMOUS HISTORICAL FIGURES. 

Throughout history, many famous individuals have owned Persian cats. Florence Nightingale had 60 cats in her lifetime, and doted on a large Persian named Mr. Bismarck. Marilyn Monroe owned a white Persian cat named Mitsou. And Raymond Chandler reportedly read the first drafts of his novels to his most discerning critic, a black Persian named Taki. 

<li>5. THEY'RE LOW MAINTENANCE.

Persians might look prissy and aloof, but they’re actually considered to be one of the most low-maintenance—and friendliest—cat breeds.

My favoriet "Wild Animal" would have to be the Wolf. I love their fur, and I love how much energy they have. At my grand parents house alot used to come by and I always played with them. 

<li>Wolves are the largest members of the dog family.
<li>‘Canis Lupis‘ is Latin for Grey Wolf, which is the most common.
<li>It is believed that the Red Wolf (also known in Latin as ‘Canis Rufus‘) is to be a cross-breed of Grey Wolf and coyote.
<li>The ‘Canis Simensis‘ (Ethiopian Wolf) lives in Africa.
<li>The domestic dog (known in Latin as ‘Canis Familiaris‘) shares many wolf traits.
